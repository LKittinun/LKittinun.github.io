    "text": "In the bottom-up proteomic experiment, proteins are enzymatically digested into peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis. However, due to the complex structures of proteins, certain protein sites may be partially or completely inaccessible to the enzymatic cleavage. This situation eventually leads to missed cleavagesâ€”where peptides are longer than expected due to uncleavage at intended sites. Too many missed cleavages can complicate peptide identification and quantification in downstream analysis."

So if the real cleavage results longer sequence than these, it means that there was incomplete digestion occurred.

In the real situation, our bottom-up proteomic experiment often allows only 0-1 missed cleavage theoretical peptides in the search space for identification (so the result will only contain peptides with missed cleavage &lt;2), since missed cleavage &gt;1 results in an inconsistent peptide pattern and thus a larger search space and poor quantification result. There was an exception in some samples, e.g., plasma, which was expected to have a high missed cleavage count due to nonspecific cleavage from plasma enzymes. In this case, we might increase the missed cleavage threshold to 2."

    "text": "How to reduce missed cleavage?\nThe principle of digestion improvement is to prepare proteins to be in a condition that is suitable for digestion, or improve digestion efficiency.\n\nUse the precipitation method to obtain purer proteins.\nReduce non-specific digestion from other enzymes (since we are only interested in particular enzymatic digestion, e.g., trypsin). This can be done by heat or by adding protease inhibitors.\nReduce and alkylate proteins.\nUse a higher enzyme-to-protein ratio.\nUse multiple enzymes. Most commonly, we use Lys-C in conjunction with trypsin, since Lys-C specifically cleaves C-terminal K. Our experience found that adding Lys-C results in 5-10% cleavage efficiency.\nUse a suitable time and temperature for specific enzymes. Too short will cause missed cleavage, but too long will cause autolysis and excessive digestion."
